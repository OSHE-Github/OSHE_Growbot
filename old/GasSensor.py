#Description: This is a template file to be used when adding new sensors to the gowbot. The website pulls data from both the sensor table and the sensorreading table in the sqlite3 database to create the graphs. So in order to add a new sensor you will need to get the data from the sensor, populate the sensor database with a name and unit for every reading, and put the datetime, sensor name, and value of the reading in the sensorreading table of the database. e.g. "Generic-Sensor Temperature" for the name and "Â°C" for the units in the sensor table; and "datetime" for the date, "Generic-Sensor Temperature" for the name, and a numer for the value in the sensorreading table. Look through this file and its comments to follow how the methods imported from model.py are used to achieve this. If more reference is needed, SoilSensorReadOnly.py is in this same directory, and is just this file edited for use with an adafruit_circuitpython_seesaw sensor. One last thing to note (if you are still indeed reading this) is that you will need to have a sensor entry for every value that you wish to store. That is why I formatted the sensor names like "Generic-Sensor Temperature" as (for many sensors) they can read multiple values in, so you would need to add another sensor to the database named "Generic-Sensor [name of other thing being measure e.g. Moisture]" to be able to properly graph and store the data.
