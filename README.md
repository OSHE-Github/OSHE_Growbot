# OSHE Growbot

The Growbot project was begun by Michigan Technological University's [Open Source Hardware Enterprise](http://openhardware.eit.mtu.edu/).

## Project Goal

Create an open source robotic platform that will be able to offload most if not all tasks of gardening to a fully autonomous robot.
